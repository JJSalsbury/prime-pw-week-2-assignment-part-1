    <p>In regards to conditionals, when comparing variables I know you can use a few ways to check if they are equal values. In the "conditional conceptual" video, when going over the different ways to compare values, we're told we would go over the differences in using == (compared true with type converions, and === (compared true with exact match only), but I can't find where this is explained in more depth. I still don't undestand the difference?</p>
    <p>When I look at other references ("Java Script and Jquery" by John Ducket) they talk about declaring a variable using Var. We have used let to declare variables. What exactly is the difference?
    <p>When creating variables and adding two string values together, I've learned that you can make a space between two different strings by adding the space to the string, or by adding a + " " + inbetween the two string variables. Is there a prefered way to do this? Can you do either?</p>
    <p>In question 5 and 6 of the describe.js portion of our assignent, both questions state that we start with two variables but in the code each question designates a constant ("const time" and "const minAge"). Should we be correcting this since the description asks specifically for variables and does not specifically request designating anything as constant? I did correct this initially but then considered that constants are still variables, so I ommited my corrections... Any thoughts?</p>
